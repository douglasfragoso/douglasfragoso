# Hi, my name is Douglas 👋 

Building on a solid foundation in management — with Technical, Technologist, and Bachelor’s degrees — I previously led operations in the healthcare sector, overseeing financial, contractual, and strategic negotiations. This trajectory allowed me to develop a systemic perspective and a sharp business acumen, which are now the primary differentiators in my technology career.

Currently, I specialize in FullStack development with a focus on Java, Spring Boot, and React JS. My technical growth is driven by an MBA in Software Engineering at the University of São Paulo (USP), where I deepen my expertise in software architecture, cloud computing, programming paradigms, and databases. I am passionate about building scalable, secure, and high-quality solutions, always prioritizing clean code and API development best practices.

At present, I serve as a Software Testing Intern (QA) with a specialized focus on Artificial Intelligence. I work directly with the validation and optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs), bridging the technical precision of software testing with AI innovation. My goal is to contribute to disruptive projects where I can leverage both my business process experience and engineering skills to solve complex challenges.
